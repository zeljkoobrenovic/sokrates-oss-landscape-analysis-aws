<h1 id="guardian-repository-dataset-analysis">Guardian Repository
    Dataset Analysis</h1>
<h2 id="management-summary">Management Summary</h2>
<p>The Guardian’s code repository landscape is diverse, with nearly 200
    repositories spanning various business domains and technical functions.
    Overall, core customer-facing platforms and reader revenue projects are
    <strong>highly active and large</strong>, reflecting ongoing investment,
    while a number of smaller utilities and one-off projects show
    <strong>little recent activity</strong>.

    <br><br>Naming conventions are mostly
    consistent and descriptive, though a few outliers use unconventional
    formats. Several potential risk areas emerge: a subset of repositories
    appear <strong>unmaintained</strong> (no updates in over a year), some
    codebases are <strong>very large</strong> (hundreds of thousands of
    lines) which may pose maintainability challenges, and roughly 36
    repositories have <strong>no test code</strong>, indicating possible
    quality risks.

    <br><br>Additionally, many different programming languages and
    frameworks are in use, which suggests <strong>technology stack
        diversity</strong> that could lead to fragmentation or specialized skill
    needs. Addressing inactive projects, improving test coverage, and
    standardizing naming can help reduce technical debt and improve overall
    platform health.</p>
<h2 id="conceptual-grouping">Conceptual Grouping</h2>
<p>Based on repository naming, the codebase can be grouped into key
    business and technical domains:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Editorial &amp; Content Tools:</strong> Repos related to
        news content creation and curation. Examples include
        <code>editorial-collaboration</code>, <code>facia-tool</code> (fronts
        management tool), <code>story-packages</code> (grouping articles), and
        rich text editor libraries like <code>prosemirror-...</code> packages.
        These support journalists and editors in producing and packaging
        content.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Web Platform (Website Frontend):</strong> Repositories for
        the main Guardian website and rendering services. Notable examples are
        <code>frontend</code> (legacy website code) and
        <code>dotcom-rendering</code> (the newer web rendering service). Also
        included are related monitoring or Lambda services
        (e.g. <code>frontend-lambda</code>) and <code>dotcom-</code> prefixed
        utilities.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Reader Revenue (Support &amp; Membership):</strong> Projects
        supporting subscriptions, contributions, and supporter engagement. For
        example, <code>support-frontend</code> (the supporter sign-up site) and
        its associated services (<code>support-admin-console</code>,
        <code>support-analytics</code>, <code>support-reminders</code>,
        <code>support-service-lambdas</code>) manage subscriptions, payments,
        and membership. Repos like <code>members-data-api</code> and
        <code>memsub-promotions</code> also fall here.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Mobile Apps &amp; Services:</strong> Repos with the
        <code>mobile-</code> prefix relate to the Guardian’s mobile
        applications. This includes <code>mobile-apps-api-models</code> and
        <code>mobile-apps-article-templates</code> (shared models and templates
        for apps), as well as supporting utilities like
        <code>mobile-notifications-content</code>,
        <code>mobile-save-for-later</code>, <code>mobile-purchases</code>
        (in-app purchases), and platform-specific tools
        (<code>bridget-android</code>, <code>bridget-swift</code> for bridging
        app and web content).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Media Management (Pluto &amp; Grid):</strong> A suite of
        repositories for handling media assets (images, videos). The
        <strong>Grid</strong> is the Guardian’s image management system
        (<code>grid</code>, <code>grid-cerebro</code>, <code>grid-cli</code>,
        <code>grid-feeds</code>). <strong>Pluto</strong> appears to be a project
        for video/media workflow, with many repos prefixed <code>pluto-</code>
        (e.g. <code>pluto-core</code>, <code>pluto-mediabrowser</code>,
        <code>pluto-deliverables</code>) covering storage, browsing, and
        deliverable management of media.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Analytics &amp; Data (Ophan &amp; Others):</strong>
        Repositories related to tracking and data analysis.
        <strong>Ophan</strong> is the in-house analytics platform (repos like
        <code>ophan-housekeeper</code>, <code>ophan-geoip-db-refresher</code>,
        <code>ophan-google-search-index-checker</code>). Other data/analytics
        tools include <code>contributions-ticker-calculator</code> (likely for
        contribution metrics), <code>newsletters-nx</code> (newsletter
        platform), <code>newswires</code> (ingesting newswire content), and
        various content data pipelines (<code>content-api-*</code> clients and
        tests, <code>recommendations</code>).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Advertising &amp; Commercial:</strong> Repos supporting
        advertising, marketing, and commercial operations. Notable are
        <code>commercial</code>, <code>commercial-shared</code>,
        <code>commercial-templates</code> (ad templates or logic), and
        integration with third-parties like <code>google-admanager-api</code>.
        Also, <code>braze-components</code> (related to Braze marketing
        platform) and <code>consent-management-platform</code> (for user
        consents/CMP) fall in this group.
    </li>
    <li><strong>User Identity &amp; Security:</strong> This includes
        authentication/authorization systems and secure communication tools.
        Repos like <code>identity-processes</code> (user identity workflows),
        <code>pan-domain-authentication</code> and <code>pan-domain-node</code>
        (single sign-on across “*.gutools” domains), and
        <code>login.gutools</code> (the login app for internal tools) cover
        identity. Security-focused projects include <code>security-hq</code>
        (security dashboard), <code>secure-contact</code> and the
        <strong>SecureDrop</strong> client/workstation for whistleblowing
        (<code>securedrop-client</code>,
        <code>securedrop-workstation</code>).
    </li>
    <li><strong>DevOps &amp; Infrastructure:</strong> A range of internal
        tools for operations, deployments, and cloud infrastructure. For
        instance, <strong>Riff-Raff</strong> (<code>riff-raff</code>) is the
        deployment pipeline, <strong>Prism</strong> (<code>prism</code>) is an
        AWS inventory service, <strong>Amigo</strong> (<code>amigo</code>)
        manages AMIs, <strong>Amiable</strong> monitors AMIs, and
        <strong>Anghammarad</strong> (named repo for alerts). Repos prefixed
        with <code>actions-</code> (e.g. <code>actions-riff-raff</code>,
        <code>actions-npm-dependencies</code>) are custom GitHub Actions for
        CI/CD. <code>cdk</code> and <code>cdk-playground</code> relate to AWS
        Cloud Development Kit. Other infra utilities include
        <code>cloudwatch-logs-management</code>,
        <code>fastly-cache-purger</code> (and
        <code>mobile-fastly-cache-purger</code>), <code>s3-upload</code>, and
        <code>elasticsearch-node-rotation</code>. The <code>gateway</code> and
        <code>gatehouse</code> may handle dev environments or proxies.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Client Libraries &amp; Platform Shared Code:</strong>
        Various libraries and components used across systems. For example,
        <code>content-api-scala-client</code> (Guardian Open Platform client),
        <code>targeting-client</code> (perhaps for personalization or ad
        targeting), <code>play-googleauth</code> (Play framework module for
        Google Auth), <code>simple-configuration</code> (configuration library),
        <code>thrift-serializer</code> and <code>french-thrift</code> (Thrift
        models for content/analytics, one notably for French content tracking).
        The <strong>Source</strong> design system appears in
        <code>source-apps</code>. There are also design/interactive tooling
        repos such as <code>ai2html</code> and
        <code>chloropleth_map_maker</code> (graphics tools), and
        <code>interactive-*</code> repos which seem to be templates or assets
        for interactive articles (e.g.,
        <code>interactive-atom-thrasher-template</code>,
        <code>interactive-now-and-then-embed</code>).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Editorial Automation &amp; Workflow:</strong> Beyond content
        creation, some tools support editorial process automation. For instance,
        <code>workflow-frontend</code> (likely an editorial workflow UI),
        <code>flexible-*</code> repos (perhaps related to an older CMS called
        “Flexible”, e.g. <code>flexible-octopus-converter</code>,
        <code>flexible-restorer</code> for content migration or restoration),
        and <code>editorial-tools-user-telemetry-service</code> (captures usage
        telemetry of editorial tools). <code>editors-picks-uploader</code> also
        fits here (managing Editors’ Picks content).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Subscriber Fulfillment &amp; CRM:</strong> A few
        repositories relate to managing print subscription fulfillment and
        customer relations, e.g. <code>national-delivery-fulfilment</code>
        (likely print home delivery management) and <code>invoicing-api</code>
        or <code>payment-failure-comms</code> (communication on payment
        failures). The <code>zuora-</code> prefixed repos
        (<code>zuora-full-export</code>, <code>zuora-invoice-write-offs</code>)
        deal with data export and adjustments in the Zuora billing system (used
        for subscriptions).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Miscellaneous/Other:</strong> A handful of projects don’t
        neatly fit the above but serve specific needs –
        e.g. <code>discussion-avatar</code> (comment system avatar service),
        <code>pressreader</code> (possibly integration with PressReader for
        digital newspapers), <code>archivehunter</code> (archiving tool),
        <code>recipes-backend</code> (perhaps for a recipes section),
        <code>hackday-ever-elusive-kudo</code> (a hackday project), and internal
        documentation sites like <code>guardian-engineering-site</code>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>These conceptual groupings show that the repositories cover
    everything from content creation and delivery, audience analytics,
    revenue products, to internal tooling and infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="naming-patterns-and-inconsistencies">Naming Patterns and
    Inconsistencies</h2>
<p><strong>Common Naming Patterns:</strong> Guardian repositories
    largely follow a consistent naming scheme:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <strong>use of hyphen-separated lowercase words</strong> is
        prevalent. Most repo names are descriptive combinations of terms. For
        example, <code>support-admin-console</code> and
        <code>content-api-scala-client</code> use hyphens to separate words and
        all-lowercase text.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Prefixes indicating domains or teams</strong> are common.
        Many names start with a keyword that groups related projects: e.g.,
        <code>editorial-</code> for editorial tools, <code>mobile-</code> for
        mobile app related projects, <code>ophan-</code> for analytics,
        <code>pluto-</code> for media pipeline, <code>support-</code> for
        supporter revenue, <code>commercial-</code> for ad tools, etc. This
        helps quickly identify a repo’s context.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Functional Suffixes</strong> often denote the repo type.
        Examples include suffixes like <code>-service</code> (indicating a
        service/microservice,
        e.g. <code>editorial-tools-user-telemetry-service</code>),
        <code>-client</code> (client library, as in
        <code>content-api-scala-client</code>), <code>-frontend</code> or
        <code>-backend</code> (to distinguish UI vs server components,
        e.g. <code>support-frontend</code>), <code>-lambda</code> (AWS Lambda
        functions, e.g. <code>podcasts-analytics-lambda</code>), and platform
        indicators such as <code>-android</code> or <code>-swift</code> for
        platform-specific code.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Use of real words or established terms:</strong> Many names
        are self-explanatory (e.g., <code>grid-cli</code>,
        <code>fastly-cache-purger</code>) or use known project codenames within
        Guardian (e.g., “riff-raff”, “prism”, “amiable”). In general, the naming
        leans toward clarity about the repository’s purpose or the system it
        belongs to.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inconsistencies and Odd Patterns:</strong> Despite general
    consistency, there are a few naming irregularities:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A few repositories use <strong>underscores or dots instead of
        hyphens</strong>, contrary to the common style. For instance,
        <code>chloropleth_map_maker</code> is one of the only names using
        underscores, and <code>login.gutools</code> contains a period in its
        name. These stand out against the predominantly hyphenated names.
    </li>
    <li>A small number of names appear in <strong>CamelCase or include
        uppercase acronyms</strong>, which is inconsistent with the usual
        lowercase convention. Examples: <code>VaultDoor</code> (capitalized
        CamelCase) and <code>CDS-K8s</code> (contains uppercase “CDS” and
        “K8s”). Most other repos are all-lowercase, so these are exceptions
        likely due to specific naming needs (e.g., “CDS” might be an acronym for
        a system).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Mixed separator usage:</strong> While hyphens are standard,
        we see one case of a dot (<code>login.gutools</code>) and the underscore
        example above. This inconsistency could lead to slight confusion or
        extra effort when searching for repos (e.g., one might expect
        <code>login-gutools</code> for consistency).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Prefix collisions or ambiguity:</strong> Some prefixes are
        used both broadly and specifically. For example, <code>support-</code>
        consistently refers to supporter revenue projects, but
        <code>frontend</code> appears both as a standalone repo name and as a
        prefix in others like <code>workflow-frontend</code>. Similarly, the
        term “front” appears in different contexts (<code>frontend</code>
        vs. <code>front-press-monitor</code>). This is minor, but occasionally a
        prefix doesn’t fully clarify context (e.g., <code>manage-frontend</code>
        vs <code>workflow-frontend</code> are different domains despite both
        ending in “-frontend”).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Cryptic or code-named repositories:</strong> A few repos
        have non-obvious names that don’t describe their function unless one is
        already aware of the project. For instance, <code>prout</code>,
        <code>giant</code>, <code>marley</code> are short or code-named and
        require prior knowledge to understand their purpose. While many of these
        (Prism, Riff-Raff, etc.) are known internal tool names, to newcomers
        they can be unclear. In some cases, there are redundant or varying
        references to the same name (e.g., a contributor list might show both
        guardian email and GitHub username variations of the same person, but
        that’s more about data than naming).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Inconsistent casing of acronyms:</strong> Most acronyms are
        uppercase (e.g., <code>CDS</code> in <code>CDS-K8s</code>), but others
        are lowercase or mixed (the <code>gutools</code> in
        <code>login.gutools</code> is lowercase, which is fine, but
        <code>Gutools</code> isn’t used). The inconsistency is minimal overall
        but present in a handful of names.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the naming conventions are largely systematic
    (hyphenated, contextual names), with just a handful of outliers (use of
    <code>_</code>, <code>.</code>, CamelCase) that break the pattern. These
    inconsistencies, though few, could slightly hinder discoverability or
    violate the principle of least surprise for developers navigating the
    repos.</p>
<h2 id="size-and-activity-analysis">Size and Activity Analysis</h2>
<p>Analyzing lines of code, contributor counts, and recent commit
    activity reveals significant differences across the identified
    groups:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Large, Active Codebases (Core Platforms):</strong> The most
        sizable repositories belong to the core web and reader revenue
        platforms, which also have the highest development activity. For
        example, the <strong>Support Frontend</strong> repository (supporter
        platform website) contains nearly <em>80k lines of main code</em> (with
        ~33k lines of tests) and saw 810 commits in the last 90 days. The
        <strong>Dotcom Rendering</strong> repository (new website rendering
        service) is even larger at about <em>198k lines of code</em>, with
        hundreds of commits in recent months. The legacy
        <strong>frontend</strong> monolith (the older website codebase) still
        has ~156k LOC and remains under active maintenance (374 commits in 90
        days). These numbers highlight both substantial functionality and
        ongoing investment. Notably, these big projects also have large teams:
        for instance, over 500 individuals have contributed to
        <code>frontend</code> over its lifetime (reflecting its age and
        open-source history), and <code>dotcom-rendering</code> similarly has a
        broad contributor base (the JSON shows dozens of recent contributors).
        High activity in these repos indicates they are critical and regularly
        updated.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Moderate Size, Active Domains:</strong> The
        <strong>Editorial Tools</strong> and <strong>Support Services</strong>
        groups show moderate-to-large codebases with steady activity. The
        primary editorial frontend, <strong>facia-tool</strong> (used for
        curating front pages), has ~71k LOC and an active commit history. The
        <strong>Manage-Frontend</strong> (subscription management site) and
        <strong>Support-Service-Lambdas</strong> (backend services for supporter
        revenue) each have on the order of 50–55k LOC; these too are actively
        developed. For example, support-service-lambdas saw 600+ commits in the
        past quarter (one of the highest after the main support frontend) and
        interestingly has a very high test code count (75k test LOC vs 55k main,
        implying strong test coverage). Editorial tools like
        <code>workflow-frontend</code> and <code>editorial-collaboration</code>
        are smaller in LOC but have continuous updates (these tools evolve with
        newsroom needs, though typically with fewer contributors than the
        public-facing products).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Mobile Repos:</strong> The mobile-related repositories are
        generally smaller in code size. Many are libraries or services (often
        under 10k LOC), though a couple stand out (e.g.,
        <code>bridget-android</code> has ~31k LOC). Activity in mobile repos
        varies: core shared models (<code>mobile-apps-api-models</code>) and
        templates see periodic updates, but others are relatively quiet. Recent
        commit data shows some mobile services (like
        <code>mobile-purchases</code> or <code>mobile-notifications</code>) have
        had commits this year, but the volume is lower compared to web projects.
        The mobile group overall has fewer active contributors at any given
        time, reflecting a smaller team focus.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Infrastructure/DevOps Tools:</strong> Most
        infrastructure-oriented repos (deployment tools, cloud utilities) are
        moderate in size (a few thousand LOC to maybe low tens of thousands) and
        tend to have sporadic but ongoing activity. For example,
        <strong>Riff-Raff</strong> has ~22k LOC and has seen contributions, but
        nowhere near the pace of product code – it’s likely in maintenance mode
        with occasional updates for new features or security fixes. Tools like
        <strong>Prism</strong>, <strong>Amiable</strong>, <strong>Security
            HQ</strong> are under 10k LOC and usually maintained by a small set of
        contributors. They typically get updates as needed (e.g., Security HQ
        might get periodic security improvements). The commit frequency for many
        of these in the last 90 days is low (often single-digit commits),
        suggesting they are relatively stable.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Media Pipeline (Pluto) and Grid:</strong> The
        <strong>Grid</strong> image management system is a substantial codebase
        (~57k LOC) and has had a fair number of contributors (around 139
        historically), with some activity continuing (commits in the last month
        or two). The <strong>Pluto</strong> suite consists of many smaller repos
        (~5k–20k LOC each). Individually, Pluto components like
        <code>pluto-core</code> (~38k LOC) and <code>pluto-mediabrowser</code>
        (~6k LOC) are not extremely large, and their recent activity levels are
        relatively low – some Pluto repos show 0 commits in the last quarter.
        This could indicate that the Pluto system as a whole is either mature or
        possibly being phased out. The number of contributors on each Pluto repo
        is modest (often just a handful of people have worked on each), implying
        specialized teams.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Analytics and Data:</strong> The Ophan analytics-related
        repos and other data tools are generally small in LOC and maintained by
        small teams. For example, <code>ophan-housekeeper</code>,
        <code>ophan-geoip-db-refresher</code> etc., might each have just a few
        hundred lines to a few thousand lines of code. They have low commit
        frequency recently (some had 0 commits in last 30/90 days) – likely
        because these are simple utilities that don’t need frequent changes.
        Contributor counts on these are also low (often the same 2–3 data
        engineers appear across multiple analytics repos). One exception in size
        is <strong>french-thrift</strong>, which is a large repo (~215k LOC) but
        this appears to be an outlier (possibly auto-generated code or a forked
        library for Thrift models). Its activity is low (last significant update
        in 2024) and despite its huge LOC, it likely doesn’t represent ongoing
        development work.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Commercial &amp; Ads:</strong> The commercial-related repos
        (e.g., <code>commercial</code>, <code>commercial-shared</code>,
        <code>braze-components</code>) tend to be moderate in size (a few
        thousand LOC each) and have a moderate number of contributors (the core
        commercial engineering team). Activity in the last year on these has not
        been as high as the reader revenue or platform teams – for instance,
        <code>commercial-shared</code> had its latest commit in late 2024 and 0
        commits in recent months, suggesting a stable library. Some commercial
        repos like <code>consent-management-platform</code> (CMP) might see
        occasional bursts of work (e.g., when legal requirements change).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Other domains:</strong> Repos related to
        <strong>Security/Identity</strong> (e.g.,
        <code>pan-domain-authentication</code>, <code>janus-app</code>) and
        <strong>Open Platform/API</strong> (<code>content-api-*</code> clients)
        show moderate activity. The identity and security tools have a steady
        trickle of commits (for upkeep with security patches or new
        integrations). The content API client libraries are open-source and
        widely used, which is reflected in relatively high contributor counts
        (the Scala client has 100+ contributors over time) and ongoing
        maintenance commits (though not high volume, just consistent over years
        to support API changes and Scala version bumps).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Inactive or Low Activity Projects:</strong> There are a set
        of repositories that are clearly not in active development. These
        include many of the small one-off projects or older experiments, which
        we detail in the next section. In terms of group impact: the
        <strong>Interactive team’s</strong> repos (like interactives for
        specific stories) often fall here – they have code specific to past
        projects (e.g., election or story-specific visualizations) and see
        little to no updates after initial creation. Similarly, some ops tools
        (maybe older ones replaced by newer systems) show minimal activity.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>In highlighting the extremes: the <strong>largest codebases</strong>
    are in the Web Platform and Support domains (tens to hundreds of
    thousands of LOC, with correspondingly large teams and high commit
    rates), whereas the smallest are utility scripts or legacy interactives
    (often &lt;1k LOC, sometimes single-maintainer, and dormant). The
    <strong>most contributors</strong> tend to be on long-lived, widely used
    projects (<code>frontend</code>, <code>dotcom-rendering</code>,
    <code>facia-tool</code>, <code>support-frontend</code>,
    <code>grid</code>, and the content API client), each accumulating dozens
    of contributors over time. The <strong>highest recent commit
        activity</strong> is concentrated in support/contributions and the new
    website platform – indicating strategic focus areas – while areas like
    Pluto, older interactives, or certain infrastructure tools have few or
    no recent commits, indicating stability or de-prioritization. This
    variance suggests where development effort is currently focused versus
    which parts of the codebase might be candidates for cleanup or
    archival.</p>
<h2 id="potentially-inactive-repositories">Potentially Inactive
    Repositories</h2>
<p>Using criteria such as “no commits in the last year” and/or a last
    commit date over 18 months ago, we can identify a handful of
    repositories that appear potentially inactive or in maintenance-only
    mode:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Interactive Boot Scripts:</strong> The
        <code>interactive-boot-scripts</code> repository is a clear example of
        an abandoned project. It hasn’t been updated since May 2016. With only
        24 total commits and none in recent years, this repo is essentially
        dormant.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Interactive Atom Thrasher Template:</strong> This template
        repo for interactive “thrashers” (special page elements) saw its last
        commit in June 2023. That’s nearly two years ago, and it had 0 commits
        in the past year. It’s likely not under active development now.
    </li>
    <li><strong>OZ BlueSky Test:</strong> The <code>oz-bsky-test</code> repo
        (probably a test integration with Bluesky or an experiment) had its last
        commit in November 2023. In roughly 18 months since, no further commits
        have occurred (0 in last 90 days). With only 12 commits total, this
        looks like a short-lived experiment that has since been shelved.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Interactive Gaza Damage</strong> and <strong>Email
        MVT:</strong> These are examples of niche projects that have fallen
        quiet. <code>interactive-gaza-damage</code> (an interactive graphic,
        last commit January 2024) and <code>email-mvt</code> (an email
        multivariate test project, last commit March 2024) each have had no
        commits in over a year. They border the 18-month mark for inactivity.
        They likely served a one-time purpose (news coverage or a specific test)
        and then development ceased.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Miscellaneous small repos:</strong> Several other small
        repositories show a pattern of near-zero recent activity. For instance,
        <code>chloropleth_map_maker</code> (a data visualization tool) shows
        only 2 contributors and a recent commit in early 2025 by an automation –
        it may not be actively developed feature-wise. Repos like
        <code>example-typescript-lambda</code> or
        <code>oz-2022-cpi-explorer</code> were probably experimental or tutorial
        in nature and have seen no meaningful updates lately.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, only a relatively small fraction of Guardian’s
    repositories appear truly inactive by the “&gt;1 year no commits”
    definition – on the order of <strong>5–10 repositories</strong> stand
    out as likely unmaintained. These are often either very old
    (e.g. 2016-era) or very niche. It’s also worth noting many others have
    low activity but at least one commit within the last year (possibly
    maintenance like dependency bumps or automated security fixes), which
    keeps them just out of the “completely inactive” category. The above
    examples (interactive-boot-scripts, interactive templates, etc.) are
    those that clearly meet the criteria of having had no meaningful changes
    for a long time.</p>
<h2 id="potential-risks">Potential Risks</h2>
<p>Based on the dataset analysis – considering repository sizes,
    activity levels, testing coverage, contributor counts, naming, and
    diversity – several potential risk areas emerge:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Technical Debt &amp; Lack of Maintenance:</strong> The
        presence of repositories with <strong>no recent commits for extended
            periods</strong> suggests pockets of unmaintained code. These could
        accumulate technical debt (outdated libraries, unpatched
        vulnerabilities) and knowledge loss. For example, a very old repo like
        <code>interactive-boot-scripts</code> (last updated 2016) is likely
        running with years-old dependencies. Inactive but still deployed
        services could pose reliability and security risks if they are not kept
        up to date. It may be unclear if such repos are still in use; if they
        are, they need attention, and if not, they might be candidates for
        archiving to reduce clutter. Generally, code in maintenance mode can
        become brittle – the team should periodically review whether to invest
        in updates or decommission those components.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Key Person Dependency:</strong> Many repositories have
        <strong>very low contributor counts</strong>, often just two or three
        people ever contributing. This implies that knowledge of those codebases
        is concentrated in a few individuals. If those individuals leave or move
        to other teams, the project could be left without expertise. For
        instance, <code>oz-bsky-test</code> has only 2 contributors listed, and
        <code>climate-data-cli</code> also shows just 2 contributors in its
        history (one Guardian dev and one external) – meaning only one person
        might really understand each. A single-maintainer scenario is risky;
        there’s limited code review, and bus factor is low. Ensuring multiple
        developers are familiar with each critical repo, or documenting them
        well, would mitigate this risk. It may also be worth examining if any
        critical systems are in the hands of only one or two people (though most
        mission-critical ones like frontend have many contributors, some medium
        importance tools might not).</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Code Complexity &amp; Maintainability:</strong> The
        <strong>very large repositories</strong> (tens of thousands of LOC)
        present maintainability challenges. A codebase like
        <code>dotcom-rendering</code> (~198k LOC) or <code>frontend</code>
        (~156k LOC) is inherently complex. They consist of hundreds or thousands
        of files and likely implement a wide range of features built up over
        years. Such size can slow down onboarding (new developers need to grasp
        a huge codebase), increase the chance of bugs (more surface area), and
        make big refactors risky. While these large projects are actively worked
        on (mitigating the risk somewhat through continuous refactoring and
        improvement), their sheer scale means technical debt needs to be
        carefully managed. Regular modularization, cleanup of dead code, and
        up-to-date documentation are necessary to keep them healthy. There’s
        also a risk that some large older codebases (like the
        <code>frontend</code> Play application) contain legacy patterns or
        outdated frameworks that are hard to modernize – which can become a drag
        on productivity or deployment (e.g., if tied to older versions of
        Scala/Play). It’s worth noting positively that some large repos do have
        substantial test suites (e.g., <code>frontend</code> has ~38k lines of
        test code, which helps with maintainability by catching
        regressions).</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Insufficient Testing:</strong> A notable number of
        repositories have <strong>little or no test code</strong>, raising
        quality and reliability concerns. According to the data, 36 repositories
        have 0 test LOC. For example, <code>ophan-thrift-swift</code> (a Swift
        codebase for analytics models) shows <strong>0</strong> test files or
        lines, and <code>bridget-android</code> (over 31k lines of Android
        bridging code) also has <strong>no tests at all</strong>. This pattern
        is especially worrying in larger repos: a non-trivial codebase with no
        automated tests means any change could inadvertently break functionality
        without detection. It also suggests those repos might not have undergone
        rigorous TDD or QA, possibly due to being quick prototypes or relying on
        manual testing. Repositories related to interactives or one-off projects
        often lacked tests (which might be acceptable if they’re throwaway), but
        if any of these no-test repos are in production use or expected to be
        maintained long-term, that’s a risk. On the flip side, some teams have
        excellent testing (support services have more test LOC than main code,
        indicating an emphasis on quality), so the risk is uneven – it’s
        concentrated in specific repos. The organization should review which
        important services lack tests and consider backfilling tests or
        refactoring to make them testable. Lack of tests also ties into key
        person risk – if only the original author knows how it’s supposed to
        work (with no tests as living documentation), maintenance by others
        becomes hard.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Technology Stack Fragmentation:</strong> The dataset
        suggests a <strong>broad mix of programming languages and
            frameworks</strong> across the organization – likely Scala,
        JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Swift, Kotlin/Java Android, etc. For
        example, the presence of <code>ophan-thrift-swift</code> (Swift code)
        alongside <code>bridget-android</code> (Android/Kotlin) and many
        Scala-based services (<code>identity-processes</code>,
        <code>pan-domain-authentication</code>) and Node/React apps
        (<code>dotcom-rendering</code>, <code>support-admin-console</code>)
        shows a wide tech spread. While using the right tool for the job is
        sensible, such diversity can pose challenges. It requires hiring and
        retaining expertise in multiple tech stacks, and context-switching for
        engineers moving between projects. It can also mean duplicated effort or
        inconsistent approaches – for instance, one team might solve a problem
        in Scala while another solves a similar problem in Node, leading to two
        different implementations to maintain. Additionally, some
        languages/frameworks might fall out of favor or lose community support
        (for example, if any project is still on Play Framework and others are
        on Node, balancing effort between them is tough). The variety (including
        less common internal languages like Swift for a backend model) could
        indicate some <strong>siloing of technology</strong> per team. This
        fragmentation risk is about <strong>consistency and
            interoperability</strong> – if not managed, it can slow down cross-team
        development and increase DevOps overhead (different build pipelines,
        testing tools for each stack). A mitigative strategy might be to
        converge on a smaller set of core technologies for new projects, and
        have clear ownership for those that are unique outliers.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Security Risks in Old/Unmaintained Code:</strong>
        Repositories that haven’t been updated in a long time may not have
        received important security patches. For example, an old service last
        touched in 2016 likely has outdated dependencies with known
        vulnerabilities. Even medium-term inactivity (2–3 years) can be enough
        for vulnerabilities to emerge (e.g., an old version of a library with a
        newly discovered CVE). If any such repos are still deployed in
        production (or their code is reused), they could be an entry point for
        security issues. Additionally, some repos (like
        <code>login.gutools</code>) handle authentication – if their naming or
        code suggests they are critical for access control, ensuring they are
        up-to-date is vital. Another security aspect is that inconsistent naming
        or organization can lead to <strong>oversights</strong> – e.g., a
        repository not clearly identified might be forgotten in security scans
        or not included in regular maintenance rotations. It’s also worth noting
        the presence of a <code>snyk-bot</code> in contributor lists of some
        repos indicates automated security fixes were attempted in some
        codebases; however, if those PRs weren’t merged or the bot isn’t run
        everywhere, some repos might lag behind. Overall, conducting regular
        dependency health checks on the low-activity repos is recommended to
        catch security issues.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Naming/Discoverability Issues:</strong> While relatively
        minor compared to the above, the <strong>inconsistent naming
            conventions</strong> could pose a productivity risk. For instance, a
        developer searching for “fastly purger” might not immediately find
        <code>mobile-fastly-cache-purger</code> if they expect all
        Fastly-related tools to be prefixed uniformly. The one-off use of
        underscores or dots might also break automation scripts that assume repo
        names are hyphenated. In an ecosystem as large as Guardian’s, having a
        clean, predictable naming scheme helps new developers and cross-team
        collaboration. The few deviations (<code>chloropleth_map_maker</code>,
        <code>VaultDoor</code>, etc.) might just be historical artefacts, but if
        they proliferated, it could lead to confusion. Ensuring new repositories
        follow a standard (all-lowercase, hyphens, meaningful prefixes) is a
        low-effort way to maintain order. Additionally, clear naming signals
        ownership – for instance, <code>braze-components</code> clearly is about
        Braze (marketing), which likely involves marketing or CX teams. If
        naming were inconsistent, that signal is lost and could hinder quick
        identification of who might maintain a given repo.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, the Guardian’s repository ecosystem is robust and
    covers a wide range of needs, but it is not without areas of concern.
    Active management of legacy projects, fostering shared ownership of
    smaller projects, enforcing good testing practices, streamlining tech
    choices, and consistent conventions will all help reduce these risks. By
    addressing the highlighted issues – such as injecting life into or
    retiring stale repos, adding tests to critical low-test code, and
    auditing security on older code – the organization can lower the chances
    of outages, security incidents, or team friction in the future.</p>
